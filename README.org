* How Much
  
[[./docs/assets/ruby_less_3_python.png]]

A Machine Learning supported project for predicting the income level class. It 
distinguishes between classes of "<= 50K" and "> 50K" in US Dollars. The
model is trained using [[https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult][Adults income dataset]] and is integrated with really simple
Rails application using [[https://github.com/nok/sklearn-porter][Sklearn-porter]] project, that generated native Ruby code.

The demo application is hosted on [[https://www.heroku.com][Heroku]] and is available [[https://how-much-ml.herokuapp.com/][here]] (please be mindful
if it takes a lot of time to load the first page - it's hosted on free service).

/Please note, the model's accuracy is around 83%, but is based on data gathered/
/in 1994, so will not be very accurate for Today's answers, nethertheless, it was/
/great experience and fun project to build!/

** Train the Model

The full research, engineering and choosing features for the model, and then
searching for the best model and parameters is described [[file:ML/Adults_income.ipynb][here]], but the summary of
findings are described here:

1. Most correlated to the target variable features were:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
    df.corr()["income_cat"].sort_values(ascending=False)
    # education            0.324409
    # hours-per-week       0.226346
    # capital-gain         0.219655
    # male                 0.205186
  #+END_SRC

2. These have been selected for training the models, which accuracy was:

  | Model         | Best accuracy |
  |---------------|---------------|
  | Decision Tree |         82.0% |
  | Random Forest |         82.5% |
  | KNN           |         82.1% |

3. The best performing model was based on the ~RandomForest~ algorithm, and this
   one will be deployed.

** Deploy the Model

~Sklearn-Porter~ is able to generate native Ruby code, which will be used deploy
the trained mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from sklearn_porter import Porter

porter = Porter(grid_for_forest.best_estimator_, language='ruby')
output = porter.export(embed_data=True, class_name='Ml::IncomeClassifierModel')

with open('../app/lib/ml/income_classifier_model.rb', 'w') as f:
    f.write(output)
#+END_SRC

This would generate a class with the following interface:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
class Ml::IncomeClassifierModel
  # ...

  def self.predict(features)
    # ...
  end

  # ...
end
#+END_SRC

That could be used as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
Ml::IncomeClassifierModel.predict([
  10, # value associated to education
  40, # value associated to hours_per_week
   0, # value associated to capital_gain
   1  # value indicating 1 for male or 0 for female
])
# => 0 or 1
#+END_SRC

** Integrate with the rest of the application

The features required for performing the prediction are expected to be passed in
specific order and the predicted value will be either ~0~ or ~1~ (for "<= 50K" and
"> 50K" respectively), so for convenience - these can be wrapped in another method.

Given the prediction will be performed based on values obtained from the form 
submitted by the user, the helper method can look like the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
class Ml
  def self.classify(submission)
    submission.classified_as = predict([
      submission.education,
      submission.hours_per_week,
      submission.capital_gain,
      submission.male ? 1 : 0
    ])
  end

  def self.predict(features)
    classes = ["<= 50K", "> 50K"]
    predicted = Ml::IncomeClassifierModel.predict(features)
    classes[predicted]
  end
end
#+END_SRC

** Summary

Even though the Machine Learning model has been trained on really old data (1994
was 25 years ago, when writing this post in 2019) and will most likely not be 
accurate for submissions of data reflecting Today's circumstances - this still was
great exercise and an amazing experience!

Now, when retrospectively considering where I spent most of my time when 
developing this simple app - I had to put more effort in building the frontend
of the application, rather than coming up with the Machine Learning engine 
powering it...
